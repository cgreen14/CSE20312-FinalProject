Brain-stormed how to best implement the different types of enemies on the map. I came up with the
idea that the game should have an abstract class (or Python's equivalent of an abstract class) for
the base Enemy class. Each different enemy would then inherit from this base Enemy class. Different
enemies of the same 'niche' (same enemy, maybe an upgraded version) will inherit further from this
inherited enemy class.

Tried to figure out how to best make an enemy follow a path, or decide to follow a path, to get to
the dedicated location on the map where they can inflict damage on your home base. I had to decide
whether enemies should follow a fixed path, or whether they should move randomly and simply implement
collision detection into the map. My idea was that the most efficient way to implement enemies
following a path would be to simply pre-program the path into the enemies. This way, the user would
also get the best experience playing the game, for they would be able to best know where to place
their towers.
